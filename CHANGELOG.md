## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- GitHub CI (lint, unit tests with coverage, definitions validate, mypy, pip-audit,
  SPDX headers), CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, dependency review and gitleaks workflows.
- Issue forms, pull request template and CODEOWNERS.
- Devcontainer with SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL and Aidbox (FHIR).
- Pre-commit hooks for secrets and PII (gitleaks) and SPDX license headers.
- Data quality assessment (`etl/dqa/`).
- DCO sign-off check for pull requests.
- CI job that builds the code-server Docker images.
- Release-note categories (`.github/release.yml`), `CHANGELOG.md` and `.editorconfig`.

### Changed

- The application package moved from `dagster_etl/` to `etl/`.
- Jupyter moved from a runtime dependency to the optional `notebooks` extra.
- Ruff replaces flake8 as the only linter. Bandit now blocks high-severity findings.
- `dagster definitions validate` is now a required CI check.
- CODEOWNERS points to `@enversion-journl/developers`.
- The code-server base image no longer installs the Microsoft ODBC driver. It installs
  only `libltdl7` and `libgssapi-krb5-2`, which `mssql-python` needs.
